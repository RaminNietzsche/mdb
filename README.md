mdb (MovieDirBrowser)
=====================

Run mdb on a folder or a set of files/folders and it downloads imdb data for all
movie files found and shows it in a nice GUI.

You can then sort the movies by rating, runtime, releaseYear or Genre.
All this data is cached on your computer, so we don't need to hit imdb
the next time.

To try it, run launcher.py with cwd as a directory with movie files.
